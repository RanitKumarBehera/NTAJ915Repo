<h1>Asia cup T20I: Inida own on Pakistan </h1>
RESULT: India beats Pakistan by 5 wickets
<pre>
IND 141/4 after 19 overs - Need 7 runs off 6 balls - Change of gloves, Rishabh Pant hands over the gloves to 
Ravindra Jadeja but that should be more of a message from the dug-out to kick-on. 
Hardik Pandya swings and India has a boundary. Advantage India as Hardik connects to the extra cover boundary.
